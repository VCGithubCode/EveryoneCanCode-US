# Build a To-Do Application with AI Features

## Summary
This training is designed to help students build a To-Do application with AI features that will be deployed to Azure.  The application will start as a simple console/terminal application and then evolve into a web application taking advantage of generative AI to help with task recommendations.  The application will be broken down into a series of sprints that will build on top of each other.  Each sprint will have a set of features and user stories that the students will implement.  The goal is to give students a hands-on experience building a real-world application that they can continue to evolve after the hackathon.

## Key Concepts that Students will Learn:
- **Everyone can code** ‚Äì and coding can come in all shapes and sizes; from a simple script/console application, to a website, to a fully commercial solution that scales to millions of users.  You do not have to build the next Facebook or YouTube to be a developer.

- **Start Small and iterate** ‚Äì some problems can be daunting if you try to solve them all at once. Break down a problem into smaller chunks that you can iterate over and incrementally make improvements to your application over time.  We have purposely broken down the problem into a series of sprints and user stories to help show how an application can evolve over many iterations. 

- **Understand the tools that can help you on the journey**:  such as IDE‚Äôs (i.e., Visual Studio Code) and how AI can both help you build your application (i.e., GitHub Copilot) as well as help you create applications with amazing capabilities

## Track Structure
- Students will be broken up into teams based on skill level and each team will be assigned a coach (i.e., CSA) to guide them through two days of learning.
- The training will be centered around building a **To-Do Application**.  Taking the students from the most basic console/terminal application, to a web application, **adding AI features** along the way, and then eventually **hosting in Azure**.
- The application will be broken down into a small set of manageable tasks (i.e., sprints and user stories) building up to the final application.  Each sprint will have some learning activities through recorded presentations to get the students up to speed on a topic, and then exercises broken up into features/user stories that they will implement.
- Each sprint will build on top of the previous sprint and students will be very hands on with the code.
    - Since each sprint builds on the previous sprint a student can join at any point in the track and start coding as each user story has a fully functional code base that the user can start from. 
- The students will be able to work at their own pace and will have the ability to ask questions of their coach as they work through the exercises.


## Getting Started
The outline below documents the sprints and user stories that you will be implementing on your journey.  If you want to go through the entire experience, please follow them in order.  However, all user stories have fully functioning code base, so they are designed to pick up from whatever sprint / user story you want to start with.

üéâ **Congratulations!**  You have completed the **Everyone Can Code** To-Do application track!!!   We hope that we "**Lit Your Fire for Coding**" and that you are excited to continue on your coding journey!

### Bonus Activities
Are you still looking for additional ideas on how you could continue to learn?  We have defined some "homework" scenarios that you can work on after this training.  These are just suggestions and would definitely encourage you to come up with your own ideas as well

- **Multiple lists per user** - Update the application to allow a user to store multiple lists underneath their account.
- **Mulit-tenant** - Update the application to allow different users to log in and see their "own" lists.
- **Different Authentication Provider** - You can experiment with setting up different authentication providers for the website. At the time of this repo being created there are providers for Facebook, Google, Twitter, GitHub, Apple, and OpenID Connect.
- **Migrate to a NoSQL database** - Migrate your backend storage from SQL to a NoSQL database like CosmosDB.
- **Create an API layer** - Create an API layer between the Web App and the database so that your to-do list can be automated by other scripts and/or programs beyond just the user interface. 

Want to continue using Azure after this event.  You can sign up [here to get started](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) with a free Azure account.
